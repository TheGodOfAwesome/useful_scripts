Script #1
ignore_norm_limits.sh

Use: ./ignore_norm_limits.sh

Place it in the folder you want to check for norminette errors as determined by the ecole42 ruby file checker NORMINETTE https://github.com/veroxy/42_norminette

Description: This is a tiny script that allows you check all your files for norme errors without having to worry if the number of files is above the number of files norminette can handle at a time. It will also check sub-directories of your root for *.c files and run norminette on these as well.

Script #2
load_desktop.sh

Use: ./load_desktop.sh

Place the script in any folder you desire and it will clone all of the 2017 repos into a folder ./2017/ in your ./Desktop/

Description: A script to help me get all my projects in one reliable place once I sit down to work :)
